# Analysis of the Mapping of Bilinear Transformation in Digital Filter Design
## Abstract
The bilinear transformation is one of the most commonly used methods in IIR digital filter design, which accomplishes the mapping from the s-plane to the z-plane. However, the current understanding of the mapping of the bilinear transformation remains somewhat lacking and the more details need 
to be revealed. In this paper, we derive some interesting conclusions about the mapping through mathematical analysis: A special line A, parallel to 
the imaginary axis in the s-plane, is mapped to a line B in the z-plane under the bilinear transformation, all the other lines, parallel to the 
imaginary axis in the s-plane, are mapped to the circles with different centers and radii in the z-plane. These circles are located on both sides 
of the line B and are tangent to the line B at the point z = â€“1. The formulas for computing the centers and radii are also derived. Numerical 
computation further verifies our conclusions.
